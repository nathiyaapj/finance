FINANCE RISK ANALYSIS

This project aims to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
and machine learning to conduct risk analysis for loan default
prediction in the context of a consumer finance company. By
analyzing historical loan application data, we will identify patterns
and factors that indicate whether a client is likely to default on their
loan payments. This analysis will assist the company in minimizing
financial losses while ensuring that creditworthy applicants are not
unfairly rejected.

Business Understanding

The lending industry faces significant challenges in assessing
creditworthiness, particularly for applicants with limited or no
credit history. Loan defaults pose financial risks to lending
institutions, making accurate risk assessment crucial. Our
primary objective is to use EDA and machine learning
techniques to understand the drivers behind loan default and
develop strategies to mitigate these risks effectively.

Business Objectives

Identify patterns indicating clients' difficulty in repaying loans through
detailed analysis of application data.
Determine the key demographic, financial, and credit-related factors
that influence loan default using machine learning models.
Utilize insights gained from the analysis to inform portfolio
management, risk assessment, and lending practices.
Develop strategies to minimize financial losses due to loan defaults
and optimize lending decisions.
